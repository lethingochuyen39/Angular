            <h1>Hazards to Be Aware Of Mountain Climbing</h1>
            <p>Mountain climbing is an inherently dangerous activity, and you need to be aware of the dangers before you
                go out. So, what are the main risks in mountain climbing? Falling, avalanche danger, exposure to the
                elements, and altitude sickness are among the most prevalent risks that you’ll face while
                mountaineering, although
                that’s far from a comprehensive list. There’s a whole host of mountain climbing risks that you’ll have
                to face if you decide to take up this sport. Some of them (like falling and exhaustion) you’ll have to
                content with every time you go mountain
                climbing, while others (like altitude sickness) will only become relevant once you start pushing the
                boundaries on some of the hardest mountains in the world. Now, this article isn’t meant to dissuade you
                from mountain
                climbing (I do it all the time, and I love it), but rather to make you aware of the dangers so that you
                can plan for them!
            </p>

            <h2>The Dangers of Mountain Climbing</h2>
            <p>Even though I’ve spent most of my life climbing mountains, I still don’t think that I was able to create
                a fully comprehensive list including all of the dangers that you’ll face. With that being said, though,
                I have
                20 main ones that you should be planning for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Falling:</b> Maybe the most common danger, and one that almost everyone is afraid of.</li>
                <li><b>Avalanches:</b> </li>
                <li><b>Weather:</b> Weather patterns in the mountains change quickly, and you can find yourself stuck if
                    the conditions suddenly turn.</li>
                <li><b>Exposure:</b> Spending tens of hours in the beating sun or freezing cold can start to mess with
                    your body and brain (I recently dropped a rappel device due to heat stroke).</li>
                <li><b>Hypothermia:</b> Spending too long in the cold will cause your body to start to shut down.</li>
                <li><b>Altitude sickness:</b> Not getting enough oxygen to your brain can muddle your thinking and cause
                    fever-like symptoms</li>
                <li><b>Pulmonary Edema:</b> A specific type of altitude sickness where blood builds up in your lungs.
                </li>
                <li><b>Cerebral Edema:</b> An even worse form of altitude sickness, where blood builds up in your brain.
                </li>
                <li><b>Exhaustion:</b> Tiring yourself out can lead to poor decision making, falls, and injuries</li>
                <li><b>Rockfall:</b> Due to erosion and temperature change, chunks of rock will come loose. Once hit
                    from these could easily kill you.</li>
                <p><a class="btn btn-default" href="hazards2.html" role="button">View More &raquo;</a></p>
            </ul>

            <p>As you can see, there’s a long list of risks to be aware of while mountain climbing. Knowing about them
                is important — but knowing how to avoid them is even more so.</p>

            <div>

                <h2>Falling</h2>
                <div><img src="img/img hazard/Falling.jpg" alt="Falling" width="90%"></div>

                <div class="what">
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> The risk of losing your purchase on the mountain in a steep section and having
                        gravity do the rest.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="danger">
                    <p> <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Above five feet, you might injure yourself in a fall; above 20,
                        there’s a very realchance that you could die.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> Strong mental capacity, navigation, and knowing your limits are all
                        important factors to avoid falling.<br> Wearing a helmet can lessen the impact of a fall.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Falling is one of the baseline fears that humans face, and for good reason. A fall from as little
                        as ten feet is enough to suffer a life-changing injury, so this is something you want to avoid
                        at all costs.
                    </p>
                    <p>Often while mountain climbing you find yourself in ‘no-fall zones’ — areas where you don’t have
                        any protection (ropes, harnesses, etc.) and a fall would result in death. In such situations,
                        it’s essential to know that you’re within your own personal limits before you enter the no fall
                        zone.
                    </p>
                    <p>Reading route descriptions, listening to more experienced people, and practicing on easier
                        terrain will all allow you to judge mountains and know if you’re good enough to venture into
                        their no-fall zones without pushing yourself too far.</p>

                <h2>Avalanches</h2>
                <div><img src="img/img hazard/Avalanches.jpg" alt="Avalanches" width="90%"></div>

                <div class="what">
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> Massive packs of snow that come loose from mountains and slide down, sometimes
                        for thousands of feet, at almost 100 miles per hour.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="danger">
                    <p><b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Avalanches can bury you alive in snow and then trap you there until
                        you suffocate (that’s if they don’t crush you to death first).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> There are two steps to avoiding avalanches: proper planning (not
                        venturing into severe avalanche terrain) and proper recovery (having the right tools and
                        partners to dig you out if you ever do get trapped).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Of all the things on this earth, avalanches scare me the most. That’s not even an exaggeration;
                        the thought of being trapped in a snowy tomb, slowly running out of air while I’m unable to
                        breath, keeps me up at night.</p>
                    <p>Avalanches are one of those uncontrollable risks that you can plan for, but you can’t do too much
                        to prevent. Often times they’re caused by factors that are completely out of your control, so
                        the only thing for you to do is to try to avoid avalanche terrain at all costs.</p>
                    <p>Of course, sometimes this isn’t possible, and you need to enter avalanche terrain to climb a
                        specific route. In these cases, even the best mountain climbers in the world are unable to
                        prevent tragedy. Alex Lowe, one of the greatest mountaineers of all time, died in a massive
                        unforeseeable avalanche.</p>

                <h2>Weather</h2>
                <div><img src="img/img hazard/Weather.jpg" alt="" width="90%"></div>

                <div class="what">
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> The risk of sudden weather changes (usually in the form of storms), which
                        happen often in the mountains.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="danger">
                    <p><b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Storms can change the conditions you’re in, which makes your
                        travelling harder and may expose you to the elements.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> Good planning and preparation are the only way to avoid this danger. You
                        should know the weather report for your specific mountain before you leave the house, and you
                        should always carry one extra layer of clothing on you (and one extra meal in case you get
                        stranded).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Weather risks are mostly related to the chance that you get caught in an unforeseen storm while
                        mountain climbing. This can expose you to the elements (leading to issues like hypothermia) and
                        can make travelling more difficult (if you crossed a narrow ridge on your way to the summit in
                        calm conditions, trying to backtrack across it when faced with wind and rain will be a lot more
                        difficult).</p>
                    <p>This is why climbers on Everest wait so long for a good weather window before they push to the
                        summit; trying to climb in the middle of a storm is so difficult that it may as well be a death
                        sentence.</p>
                    <p>There’s nothing you can really do here except plan ahead. Try to get an accurate idea of what the
                        weather on a given day will look like, and then overpack for that weather. If you think you’ll
                        need one sweater, bring two. If it’s calling for sun, bring a rain jacket. Of course, if the
                        weather looks bad, you should just stay home and plan to try again another day.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Recently, while on a multi-pitch rock climb, I spent about two hours standing around in 35-degree
                        (Celsius) weather without any water while exerting myself on a difficult climb. Half an hour
                        later, when trying to rappel, I dropped my belay device and had to perform an emergency rappel.
                    </p>
                    <p>Exposure to the elements can muddle your thinking and make it hard for you to function. Too long
                        in the sun and you’ll get a heatstroke (like I did). Too long in the cold, and you might be

                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> I’m starting to sound like a broken record here, but you need to plan if
                        you want to avoid hypothermia.</p>

                <div class="content">

                    <p>Hypothermia is one of the main dangers that mountain climbers have to contend with. When you
                        spend too long in the cold, your blood gets thick and your body eventually starts to shut down,
                        which can have
                        some pretty disastrous consequences.</p>
                    <p>Avoiding this comes down to four things:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dressing properly: Layers, layers, layers. Always bring more clothes than you need.</li>
                        <li>Calories: Having food in your stomach or a hot drink is an excellent way to combat
                            hypothermia.
                        </li>
                        <li>Moving: Another great way to prevent the symptoms from getting too bad is to move around and
                            generate heat internally.</li>
                        <li>Awareness: One of the dangers of hypothermia is that it sneaks up on you. It can muddle your
                            thinking and confuse you to the point where you actually feel warm and relaxed, even though
                            you’re
                            freezing to death. Keeping your wits about you will help you stave off the hypothermia
                            instead of succumbing to it.
                        </li>

                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> Proper acclimatization is really the only way to properly avoid altitude
                        sickness. This means going up the mountain in small chunks and descending again at night so that
                        you can sleep at lower altitudes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Altitude sickness is one of the largest threats faced by mountain climbers, especially as you
                        start getting into more technical mountaineering. It can slowly break down your body and make it
                        impossible for you to even think straight.</p>
                    <p>While people often associate mountain sickness with extreme peaks liker Everest and K2, it can
                        actually happen at much lower altitudes; when I climbed Mount Whitney in California a couple of
                        years ago, it was one of the risks we had to content with (for context, Whitney is 14,500 feet
                        tall and is the highest mountain in the lower 48).</p>
                    <p>Avoiding it is a matter of ascending tall mountains slowly, over a period of days. Alternatively,
                        you can carry bottled oxygen, though this is usually reserved for extreme circumstances.</p>
                    <p>If going up over the course of several days isn’t an option (we only had one day to climb
                        Whitney, for example), all you can really do is be aware of the threat of altitude sickness, be
                        on the lookout for the symptoms, and be ready to retreat if you or any of your partners begin to
                        show them.</p>

                <div class="what">
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> A buildup of blood in your lungs</p>
                </div>

                <div class="danger">
                    <p><b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> A pulmonary edema can make it difficult to breath; if this progresses
                        too far, you won’t be able to get any air into your lungs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> The only cure is to get to a lower altitude. If you have bottled oxygen,
                        giving it to the person may help, but <b><i>descending immediately is the only way to save their
                                life.</i></b></p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>If you’re climbing a high-altitude mountain, a pulmonary edema is probably the second-worst thing
                        that can happen to you or a member of your team. Identifiable by a shortness of breath, chest
                        discomfort, and a cough (sometimes with mucus or blood in it) this temporary condition means
                        that your blood vessels are constricting and fluid is building up in your lungs.</p>
                    <p>If you or a teammate gets a pulmonary edema, there’s nothing to do except to descend as quickly
                        as possible. Only getting to a lower altitude where more oxygen will reach the lungs can help
                        your body recover.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>I said above that a pulmonary edema was the second worst thing that could happen to high-altitude
                        climbers. With that in mind, allow me to introduce you to the worst: a high-altitude cerebral
                        edema (HACE).</p>
                    <p>A HACE is when, due to the effects of extreme altitude, your brain begins to swell. You can
                        identify it through confusion, dizziness, loss of speech, headaches, and other neurological
                        symptoms.</p>
                    <p>There’s a lot of medical jargon to throw around to explain the severity of a HACE, but I’ll try
                        to keep it simple: if you have a high-altitude cerebral edema, you need to descend immediately
                        or you will die.</p>

                <div class="danger">
                    <p><b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Fatigue makes it harder to operate. You’re more likely to trip and
                        fall, more likely to forget something, and more likely to collapse from exhaustion.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> Much like gambling, you need to know your limit and stay within it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Fatigue may not seem like a big deal, but it’s something that every mountain climber needs to be
                        aware of. On long, demanding trips, you run a very serious risk of your body beginning to break
                        down.</p>
                    <p>Everyone has a physical limit of what they’re capable of; if you try to push past this physical
                        limit, you might find your body refusing to go any farther.</p>
                    <p>This can lead to small mistakes (like dragging your tired legs too much, tripping, and breaking
                        an ankle) or massive ones (like exhausted mountaineers sitting down for a break and freezing to
                        death because they had no energy left to move).</p>
                    <p>Avoiding fatigue is a simple matter of knowing your own body and not pushing yourself too hard.
                        You need to be able to recognize how much you have left in the tank and make sure that it’s
                        enough to get back safely.</p>
                    <p><b>Pro tip:</b> One of the biggest mistakes I see in beginner mountain climbers is burning all of
                        their energy to reach the summit. Remember, the descent is both more exhausting and more
                        dangerous, so make sure to keep some energy reserves for the trip back. If not, you may find
                        yourself stranded.</p>

                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> Wear a helmet and make good decisions</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Rockfall is another one of those hazards that can be hard to mitigate, because it’s not really
                        within your control. Rocks sometimes come loose due to gravity, erosion, or other climbers, and
                        there’s little you can do to avoid it.</p>
                    <p>Because of that, I would highly recommend having a helmet with you whenever you go mountain
                        climbing, and you need to put it on any time you think you’re in an area where rockfall may be a
                        possibility.</p>
                    <p>Learning to recognize such an area is a matter of experience, but you should look for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Terrain that’s steeper than 40 degrees</li>
                        <li>High-trafficked areas</li>
                        <li>Loose rocks where you are, or rocks strewn around (could be a sign that lots of rocks fall
                            from above and land in that vicinity)</li>
                        <li>Changing of seasons (rockfall is most common in the spring)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Trips reports are also a great source of information on which routes may be more subject to
                        rockfall.</p>
