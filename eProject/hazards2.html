            <h1>Hazards to Be Aware Of Mountain Climbing</h1>
            <p>Mountain climbing is an inherently dangerous activity, and you need to be aware of the dangers before you
                go out. So, what are the main risks in mountain climbing? Falling, avalanche danger, exposure to the
                elements, and altitude sickness are among the most prevalent risks that you’ll face while mountaineering, although
                that’s far from a comprehensive list. There’s a whole host of mountain climbing risks that you’ll have
                to face if you decide to take up this sport. Some of them (like falling and exhaustion) you’ll have to content with every time you go mountain
                climbing, while others (like altitude sickness) will only become relevant once you start pushing the
                boundaries on some of the hardest mountains in the world. Now, this article isn’t meant to dissuade you from mountain
                climbing (I do it all the time, and I love it), but rather to make you aware of the dangers so that you can plan for them!
            </p>

            <h2>The Dangers of Mountain Climbing</h2>
            <p>Even though I’ve spent most of my life climbing mountains, I still don’t think that I was able to create
                a fully comprehensive list including all of the dangers that you’ll face. With that being said, though,
                I have
                20 main ones that you should be planning for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Icefall:</b> Similar to above, except this time with ice.</li>
                <li><b>Snow blindness:</b> When the sun reflects off the snow, it sometimes becomes so bright that it
                    causes temporary loss of eyesight.</li>
                <li><b>Crevasses:</b> Cracks in glaciers that can be up to hundreds of feet deep. A fall into one of
                    these can be life-ending.</li>
                <li><b>Broken equipment:</b> Although this rarely happens, it can leave you stranded when it does.</li>
                <li><b>Navigational errors:</b> If you end up in the wrong place while mountain climbing, your situation
                    could turn out a lot more dangers than you planned.</li>
                <li><b>Summit Fever:</b> Becoming obsessedwith your goal can lead to poor decision making, accidents,
                    and exhaustion.</li>
                <li><b>Injury:</b> Whether it’s a twisted ankle, a broken bone, or a concussion, unforeseen injuries can
                    strand you while mountain climbing.</li>
                <li><b>Animals:</b> Wild animals like bears, cougars, and wolves need to be taken into account when
                    climbing mountains.</li>
                <li><b>Hunger and Dehydration:</b> Not giving your body enough fuel to operate on can wear you down.
                </li>
                <li><b>Carelessness:</b> Becoming overconfident or over relaxed is a death sentence while mountain
                    climbing (especially if combined with any of the other factors.</li>
                    <p><a class="btn btn-default" href="hazards.html" role="button">&laquo; Return </a></p>
            </ul>
           
            <p>As you can see, there’s a long list of risks to be aware of while mountain climbing. Knowing about them
                is important — but knowing how to avoid them is even more so.</p>

                <h2>Icefall</h2>
                <div><img src="img/img hazard/Icefall.jpg" alt="" width="90%"></div>

                <div class="what">
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> Chunks of ice that come loose from the mountain</p>
                </div>

                <div class="danger">
                    <p><b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> For the exact same reason as rockfall.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> The exact same principles apply. You need to wear your helmet and make
                        good choices.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>All of the dangers of falling rocks are, unsurprisingly, also present with falling ice.</p>
                    <p>Icefall, thankfully, isn’t as much of a risk on most routes, but there are certain places where
                        you’ll need to be very aware of it. Helmets should be worn any time you’re underneath a large
                        chunk of ice or snow.</p>
                    <p>You should be extra cautious during the middle of the day and into early afternoon. This is where
                        temperatures are the warmest, which means the ice is more likely to heat up, fracture, and come
                        loose</p>

                        light</p>
                </div>

                <div class="danger">
                    <p><b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Going blind on a mountain side makes most things (like walking,
                        climbing, and route finding) almost impossible.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="how">
                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> Sunglasses, mountaineering glasses, or ski goggles to shield you from the
                        glare.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>In the winter or in the high alpine (basically, anywhere that there’s snow present), you need to
                        be seriously concerned with how much light your eyes are taking in. This is especially true in
                        high-altitude environments, where the atmosphere is thinner and more UV light gets in.</p>
                    <p>The solution here is pretty simple: bring some form of polarized lens to put over your eye, and
                        consider taking a backup too (if you have room in your pack). Going blind while in extreme
                        terrain can make your life a lot more difficult.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Any time you’re crossing a glacier (which happens a lot while mountain climbing), you need to be
                        concerned with the risk that crevasses present. Essentially, a crevasse is a miniature valley,
                        maybe less than three feet wide, that runs deep into the heart of a mountain.</p>
                    <p>To make matters more complicated, crevasses are often covered with a thin but fragile layer of
                        snow that makes them invisible. You’ll think you’re stepping on solid ground until your foot
                        breaks through the top layer of snow and you find yourself falling.</p>
                    <p>There are some brutal horror stories of climbers who fall into crevasses (like Chris Kerrebrock,
                        who fell in face-first, became stuck upside-down in the crevasse, and died there). If you want
                        to avoid becoming one of these stories, you should practice your glacier ropework and glacier
                        rescue religiously.</p>

                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> Proper care and use of your equipment.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Gear failures result in a very low percentage of all mountaineering accidents, but they’re still
                        worth mentioning. Any time you place your life in something (be it an ice axe designed to catch
                        you, or a ski that you’re counting on getting you down the mountain), you run the risk of that
                        thing breaking and leaving your several miles up shit’s creek.</p>
                    <p>The only way to really avoid this is to take good care of the gear that you use, and only use it
                        for what it’s designed to do. Don’t use your ice axe as a crowbar or try to hammer in a piton
                        with a crampon.</p>
                    <p>Home care is also important; make sure you’re properly washing, drying, and storing all of your
                        essential equipment. Finally, make sure to inspect your gear regularly so that you can tell if
                        any of it is nearing the end of its lifecycle.</p>

                    <p>Story time: earlier this summer, I got lost while scrambling a mountain, went way off trail,
                        ended up in some (very) steep terrain without a rope, and had to be helicopter rescued off.</p>
                    <p>If that doesn’t illustrate the value of good navigation, I don’t know what will. Finding and
                        staying on your desired trail, as well as learning how to pick the easiest route through
                        difficult terrain, can go a long way in keeping you safe.</p>
                    <p>Thankfully, modern technology has done a lot in this area. Handheld GPSs are accurate to almost a
                        meter, and you can pre-load topographical maps onto them. Even better, there are some apps out
                        there (like GAIA or AllTrails) that will do the same thing for your smartphone.</p>
                    <p>I used to be a map-and-compass snob, but after my helicopter incident, I highly recommend a GPS.

                    <p>Summit fever may sound like an absurd concept, but it’s a very real risk for mountain climbers.
                        You spend months or years training for a specific peak only to find yourself 200 meters from the
                        summit. The only thing that stands between you and your goal is a narrow, exposed ridge — and it
                        looks like a storm is starting to blow in.</p>
                    <p>In this situation, it’s so hard to pull the plug, turn around, and make the right decision. With
                        the summit so close, you feel like you deserve to get there because of all the work you’ve put
                        in.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to remember, though, that getting there could quite literally cost you your life.

                    <p>Now, obviously, injuries are bad because they can kill you (like getting whacked in the head with
                        a really big rock). When on the mountains, though, even small injuries can really complicate
                        your situation and put your life in danger.</p>
                    <p>Take, for example, a twisted ankle, which isn’t life threatening on its own, but can put you in a
                        pretty bad scenario. If you can’t walk, you’re stranded until help comes; this means you have to
                        spend longer on the mountain and more time exposed to the weather, cold, rockfall, and avalanche
                        risk.</p>
                    <p>There’s no one way to avoid injuries, so I would just say have a heightened sense of awareness
                        and bring a good first aid kit with you.</p>

                    <p><b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Humans are incredibly physically weak, and a whole host of species
                        (bears, moose, cougars, wolves) could kill you if they wanted to.</p>

                    <p><b>How to avoid it:</b> Go with a group, make lots of noise while on the trail, and carry bear
                        spray.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Animals are more of a risk for causal mountain climbs, where you’re not in alpine terrains.
                        Still, though, that’s no reason to discount them! Most of the time I go hiking or scrambling,
                        I’ll have a can of bear spray with me.</p>
                    <p>Even better than bear spray, though, is making sure the animal knows where you are in the first
                        place. Travelling with a large group and making human sounds — talking, laughing, singing — are
                        all good ways to prevent you from accidentally crossing paths with a grizzly.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Hunger and dehydration are the silent killers of mountain climbing. They sneak up on you
                        unexpectedly, without you really noticing, and then before long you find that your mouth is dry
                        or that you feel too weak to walk because you haven’t eaten anything.</p>
                    <p>The only good solution here is to overpack in terms of food and water, and to be good at
                        rationing. As a general rule of thumb I would say bring 300 calories for every 1 hour of walking
                        you expect to do, and 1 litre of water for every 2 hours of walking you expect to do (to a max
                        of 4 litres of water).</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Finally, it’s worth mentioning that your attitude can put you in danger. The moment you let your

                        life-threatening danger. That’s what happened to me when I got helicoptered off, and I would
