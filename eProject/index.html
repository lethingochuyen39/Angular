                <p >Paraclimbing is Sport Climbing for athletes with disabilities. Athletes are placed into a <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/paraclimbing/classification">Sport Class</a> Sport Class based on their disability, to allow those with a disability of a similar nature to compete within the same category.<br>

                    The IFSC has been hosting Paraclimbing competitions since 2006, when the first international event saw athletes from four National Federations compete in Ekaterinburg, Russia. The movement has grown in recent years, with a regular circuit being added to the IFSC calendar from 2010 and IFSC Paraclimbing World Championships taking place from July 2011. It has become tradition that the IFSC Paraclimbing World Championships run alongside the IFSC Climbing World Championships, promoting athletes with a disability on the same stage as other athletes. Proud of the rapid growth of the Paraclimbing community, and of the increasing standard of competitions, the IFSC remains dedicated to developing and strengthening the competitions and support available to athletes.<br>
                    
                    In 2017, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) granted the IFSC the status of “Recognised International Federation”.<br>
                    
                    In October 2018, a <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/paraclimbing/development">plan</a>  was elaborated for developing the sport further. The plan was unanimously approved at the 2019 IFSC General Assembly in Tokyo, Japan, officially declaring the start of a new era for Paraclimbing and its vibrant, committed, and enthusiastic community.</p>

                <b>2020</b>
                 A set of Paraclimbing Routesetting Guidelines were created and published by the IFSC Paraclimbing Committee.
    
                 Due to COVID-19 many Paraclimbing activities such as the Paraclimbing Classifier Course and first Classification under the lead of IPC experts were postponed, but the rework of the Classification rules and system according to the IPC Model Rules is ongoing.</p>
            <p>
                <b>2019</b>
                The Paraclimbing World Championships in Briançon, France, set new records, with 158 athletes (111 men and 47 women) representing 24 different countries participating in the event.<br>

                The IFSC General Assembly unanimously approved a <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/paraclimbing/development">Paraclimbing development plan</a>  in March 2019, with one step of the plan being to form a new <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/2-uncategorised/55-paraclimbing-committee">Paraclimbing Committee</a> .<br>

                A first Paraclimbing Routesetting Seminar was held in Sittard, the Netherlands, in November 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> 2018</b>
   
                The Paraclimbing World Championships in Innsbruck, Austria, had a new record participant number, with 126 athletes participating from 19 different countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <b> 2013 - 2017</b>
   
                Paraclimbing world cups, Paraclimbing Masters, and Paraclimbing World Championships were held, with the latter taking place every even year and including up to 72 athletes from 20 different countries.

                The Paraclimbing Commission (disbanded in 2019) made various modifications to the Paraclimbing Rule and Event Format. The Classification system was expanded up to 10 theoretical categories for men and women to ensure a fair competition.

                In 2017, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) granted the IFSC the status of “Recognised International Federation”.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <b>2012</b>
                The Paraclimbing World Championships in Paris, France, saw 61 athletes from 20 different countries competing - almost doubling the number of athletes and country representation from the previous year.

            <p>
                 <b>2011</b>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading"><a href="https://www.climbingbusinessjournal.com/climbing-gyms-and-trends-2020/">Gyms and Trends 2020</a></h2>
                <p >CBJ published that Gyms and Trends article in February, 2020. Approximately one month later, operations in the climbing industry in North America—and throughout the world— began to change drastically. A new factor emerged that became widespread and impactful at a scale never seen before in the modern gym climbing era. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic hit with full force, and its major effects are still challenging the climbing industry nearly one year later.</p>
                <p>
                    That first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic stateside in March 2020 proved to be as destructive as it was unpredictable. Gym attendance everywhere plummeted as people became increasingly cognizant (and in some cases increasingly fearful) of the Coronavirus’ transmissibility. Related to the gym industry, the Tokyo Olympics—where climbing was set to make its highly-publicized debut—were postponed. The annual Climbing Wall Association (CWA) Summit was cancelled and CWA, as the industry’s trade association, shifted to providing ongoing pandemic-related resources and support, including a roadmap for reopening.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To that point, the pandemic unified the industry, in a way, as gyms showed transparency in exchanging information on CWA community calls and surveys, sharing protocols and data, offering lessons learned and further problem solving together. In the United States, practically every climbing gym in every state was deemed a “non-essential business” and forced to temporarily close at some point in the spring or summer of 2020 as the Coronavirus continued to spread around the country. Gyms eventually reopened with significant mitigation measures (such as reservation time-slots, required face-masks, lowered capacities, and enforced social distancing…all of which contributed to a “new normal” for the climbing gym experience).
                </p>


            </div>


        </div>
        <p>
            Such collectivism by gyms was hardly a long-term silver lining, however; many gyms were forced to temporarily close again in the fall of 2020 as another wave of the COVID-19 pandemic surged; some of those gyms even chose to remain open, going against mandatory municipal orders and risking serious legal penalties—all in an attempt to stay financially afloat.
        </p>
        <p>
            The temporary closure of so many gyms amid stay-at-home orders did result in a boom for the homewall tier of the climbing industry. As early as April, CBJ announced that the “Era of Home Climbing Walls” had arrived. Indeed, 67 percent of homewall owners responding to an <a href="https://www.climbingbusinessjournal.com/strati-climbing-home-wall-survey/">October survey</a>  answered that they built their homewall in response to the pandemic. And since it is unlikely that many new homewallers will choose to quickly disassemble their walls in a post-pandemic world, this widespread interest in homewalls―as well as the uptick in at-home fitness offerings provided by gyms―will likely remain a key part of the industry going forward.

                    more than six months in 2019 – which certainly gives him some pretty high credentials in the world

                    and 14 days. In 2021 he was part of a team that completed the first summit of K2 in winter,
